Round 11
========


John Dennison
-------------

John's workplace instituted a dog limit at work. Each morning at 6 am, owners
have to wake up to create an entry in a shared google calendar. Not being one
to wake up early, John wrote a script that reads his personal calendar each
morning at 6 am, and if it sees an event with his dog's name, it will create an
entry in the shared calendar.


Jon Beluch
----------

Wrote a jenkins CLI interface since the jenkins web UI sucks really hard.

Eli Fatsi
---------

Built an LED paper lamp to show whether or not a conference room is occupied.
It runs off a sparkcore and hits the googel calendar API to see if the room is
occupied.


Tihan Seale
-----------

Tihan presented a new kind of clock that shows the position of the sun with
Unity's 3d engine.
